# My Personal Website Placeholder

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website.

## Features

- Dynamic favicon generation
- Light/Dark theme toggle
- Pixel art duck follower (optional)
- Responsive design

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/souvikchakraborty98/souvikchakraborty98.github.io.git
   ```

2. Open the project in a browser or a local server.

3. Ensure the `img` and `pdf` directories contain the required assets:
